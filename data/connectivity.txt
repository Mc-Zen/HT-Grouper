# The connectivity may be either a type or an adjacency matrix

# Allowed types are: linear, cycle, star. 
# For these, the correct number of qubits is inferred from the input data

# The adjacency matrix is specified by zeros and ones, e.g.
#
# 0 1 0 0 0
# 1 0 1 0 0
# 0 1 0 1 0
# 0 0 1 0 1
# 0 0 0 1 0
#

# linear
